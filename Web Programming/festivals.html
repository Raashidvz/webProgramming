            <h1>ONAM</h1>
            <h2>The Legend of King Mahabali</h2>
            <p>Onam is associated with the story of the Asura (demon) King Mahabali, a virtuous and benevolent ruler under whom the people of Kerala lived in peace and prosperity. The gods, threatened by his popularity and power, sought help from Lord Vishnu. 
                Vishnu took the avatar of Vamana, a dwarf Brahmin, and approached Mahabali during a ritual. Vamana asked for three steps of land, a request the king generously granted despite a warning from his guru. Vamana then grew to a colossal size and covered the earth and the heavens in two steps. For the third step, Mahabali humbly offered his own head, an act of supreme devotion. Vishnu sent Mahabali to the netherworld but, pleased with his kindness, granted him the boon to visit his people once a year. Onam celebrates this annual homecoming.
